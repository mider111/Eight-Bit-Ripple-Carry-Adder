# Eight-Bit-Ripple-Carry-Adder
Implementation of an eight-bit ripple carry adder using a java applet provided.
How to use:
1.	Execute via the terminal command:  java -jar xLogicCircuits.jar
2.	Click on Load and select the file: eight_bit_adder.xlog
3.	You can double click on the full adder to go into it to see how it works in detail and so on.
4.	Make sure the Power box in the bottom is checked.
5.	If you want to use the actual eight-bit adder just click on any of the purple inputs on the top. They represent 0s and 1s. If it is red the number in this position is a 1 and 0 if not. There are 8 inputs for the first number and 8 for the second. The output works the same way. If the green output is red the number in this position is 1 and 0 if not. Each of the two inputs and the output represent a binary number. For example if only the most left input is red it represents 1 and so on.
